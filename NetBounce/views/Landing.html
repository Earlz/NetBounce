		<h1> NetBounce</h1>
		<p>
			This is a web service which allows you to bounce HTTP requests from a local (or remote) service to your browser for easy inspection
		</p>
		<p>
			Your randomly generated key is <a href="/bounce/view/{=key=}">{=key=}</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			To bounce data into your view page, make a request to <a href="/bounce/post/{=key=}">/bounce/post/{=key=}</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This can accept POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE methods. It will display the HTTP headers, HTTP method, and any data sent with the request.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You can also use your own custom key by just going to <a href="/bounce/view/foobar">/bounce/view/foobar</a> (replace foobar in the URL with your desired key). 
		</p>
		<p>
			The view page will refresh itself every 15 seconds and pull down any data for your key on my server. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This web service is available via <a href="https://netbounce.earlz.net">HTTPS</a>. (not a self-signed certificate)
			This can be handy for testing of clients which do not permit invalid certificates when sending to an HTTPS server.
		</p>
		<h1>Warnings</h1>
		<p>
			<b>Do not send any secret data here</b>. I can't guarantee that no one else is listening in. Although I don't make the list of currently active keys public,
			If someone were to guess your key, they would be able to get all data you send. I can not guarantee any privacy on the data you send.
		</p>
		<p>
			This isn't Dropbox. Your data will expire after 1 minute on the server. It may expire sooner depending on how much data you are sending. The View page checks for new data every 15 seconds
		</p>
		<p>
			Do not send requests larger than 128Kb. I will discard them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, I know the HTTP error codes are quite incorrect right now. The MVC framework behind this, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/earlz/lucidmvc">LucidMVC</a>, is still pretty much pre-alpha. I'm surprised it works at all sometimes(although it is fast!)
		</p>
		<p>
			Please don't ruin the party by abusing this service. I have huge bandwidth limits and this puts very little load on my server. 
			If you make it to where I have to worry about the load, then I'll just take it offline. It would not be difficult to DDoS this service, but please don't
		</p>
